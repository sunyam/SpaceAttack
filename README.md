# SpaceAttack
This is a really cool shooting game implemented in Python.
You're controlling a spaceship which has the ability to shoot missiles.
Your task is to destroy as many asteroids as possible!
You lose a life whenever you collide with an asteroid; you get only 3 lives!

Parameters to tweak:
No. of lives; Minimum no. of rocks before another one is spawned

Note: It is compatible with the online Python IDE- codeskulptor.org which has a simplegui module; Alternate module- simpleguitk
It was submitted by me as the final project for Rice University's course on Coursera.
